✖ Check dependencies for packages that should not be installed directly
The package "expo-modules-core" should not be installed directly in your project. You should instead use the exported API from the expo package.
Advice:
Remove these packages from your package.json.

✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: react-native-confetti-cannon
  Unmaintained: react-native-confetti-cannon
  No metadata available: @babel/runtime, expo-modules-core, firebase
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
